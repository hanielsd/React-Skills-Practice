how to get a job offer

1. apply to less companies
   make your cv professional and prepare specific cover letter that expresses the values of the
   company and your qualifications that the company is looking for
2. build a portfolio
   don't make the usual apps like todolist
   you should instead look for your interest and should be unique
   let's say you are interested on sports then
   look for sports API and build a project accordingly
   try to host all your projects coz employers are not technical guys
   they will not be able to download and run your project on their local machine make their life simple
